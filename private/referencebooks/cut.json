        "desc": "(DreamStone Ideal) Unlike other retailers who brand an \"ideal\" grade to their cut lineup without much transparency, we take a diamond's table & depth percentages, girdle, and crown angle and if it meets our required guidelines, the diamond qualifies as an DreamStone Ideal Cut. This means the diamond is cut to more precise proportions than the finest graded cuts currently available. As our most exclusive cut, this diamond reflects maximum brilliance and fire with an equally highest quality grade of polish and symmetry for ultimate sparkle and life. Truly our finest diamond cut.
