This allows us to cut overhead costs and focus exclusively on quality and service - providing you with a high quality product at a much better value than your local jewelry store. By the same token, we understand how important it is for our customers to see and feel jewelry - especially a piece of jewelry as personal as an engagement ring. That's why we offer free shipping on all our items, a 30-day money back guarantee, and free ring resizing for 60 days after your purchase. That being said, we have offices in both Maryland and New York City, in the heart of the diamond district."
